# calculator
this is a simple calculator created in python via VSCode.
You can only use it in the Terminal window.
To use it you need to have python and this file installed (calculator.py)
Then you go in your file explorer and go to the folder you downloaded the file in and then tap here ![Screenshot 2025-04-23 171208](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ea1dde7-8dce-4509-8b6a-5257d0294ae8)
When you press it you will delete the text in there by pressing the delete button or the backspace button.![Screenshot 2025-04-23 171519](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ffd94d2-bdb3-4345-8501-16b38ea31a6e)
then write in there cmd. That is going to open the terminal window in the folder you downloaded the calculator.py file.
Now in the terminal write this "python calculator.py"
And now enjoy. 

This only works on windows and not on macOS.
if you want to open it in macOS you have to open differently.
